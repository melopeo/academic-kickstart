abstract = "Multilayer graphs encode different kind of interactions between the same set of entities. When one wants to cluster such a multilayer graph, the natural question arises how one should merge the information form different layers. We introduce in this paper a one-parameter family of matrix power means for merging the Laplacians from different layers and analyze it in expectation in the stochastic block model. We show that this family allows to recover ground truth clusters under different settings and verify this in real world data."

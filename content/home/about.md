# About me



I am a PhD student at the Machine Learning Group in Saarland University, supervised by Matthias Hein. I am currently working on extensions of Spectral Clustering to signed networks and multilayer graphs. 

Before starting my PhD studies, I did a M.Sc. in Computer Science at Saarland University together with the International Max Planck Research School for Computer Science. 

Prior to that, I did a B.Sc. in Applied Mathematics at Instituto Tecnológico Autónomo de México (ITAM). During my B.Sc. I had the wonderful opportunity of doing two internships at the Fraunhofer Institute for Digital Media Technology (Fraunhofer IDMT).

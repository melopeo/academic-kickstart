We study suitable matrix functions to merge information that comes from different kinds of interactions encoded in multilayer graphs, and its effects in cluster identification. 
We consider a family of matrix functions, known as power means, 
and show that different means identify clusters under different settings of the stochastic block model. 
For instance, we show that a limit case identifies clusters if at least one layer is informative and remaining 
layers are potentially just noise.
